# 🏃Your Olympic Path🏋️

This is a fun little project where I trained a machine learning model on the past [120 years of Olympics data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?resource=download) and built a simple webapp around it to predict what olympic event you would have been best at based on your biometrics!

## To run locally:

In the backend folder, run:

### `python ./app.py`

In the olympic-predictor folder, run:

### `npm start`

## To deploy frontend changes:

In the olympic-predictor folder, run:

### `npm run deploy`
